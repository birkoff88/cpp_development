## C++ Development Upskill Program

The **C++ Development Upskill Program** is designed to provide a structured and in-depth learning path in programming through a series of four practice-oriented courses. The program gradually builds strong foundations and prepares participants for real-world software development.

### 1. Programming Basics with C++
This course introduces the fundamental concepts of programming. Participants learn how to:

- Work with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- Declare and use variables
- Operate with data types and operators
- Use the console for input and output
- Apply conditional statements and loops

It lays the groundwork for thinking like a programmer.

### 2. C++ Fundamentals
The second course focuses on core data structures and language features, including:

- Arrays
- Functions
- Linear containers
- Strings and character sequences in C++

This module strengthens problem-solving skills and code organization.

### 3. C++ Advanced
In this stage, learners deepen their knowledge by working with:

- Dynamic memory management
- Associative containers
- Container adapters
- Multidimensional arrays

The focus is on writing more efficient, flexible, and powerful C++ programs.

### 4. C++ OOP
The final course is dedicated to **Object-Oriented Programming in C++**. Participants gain hands-on experience with:

- Classes and objects
- Constructors and destructors
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Code structure and design in larger projects

This module prepares students to work in real-world codebases and team environments.

### Program Goal
The ultimate goal of this Upskill Program is not only to deliver strong theoretical knowledge, but to prepare developers for real project requirements.

By the end of the program, participants will understand the **practical value** of their skills and be ready to apply C++ in professional environments.
